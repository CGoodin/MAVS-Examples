# MAVS-Examples
This repo contains example applications using the MSU Autonomous Vehicle Simulator (MAVS) and papers written using MAVS.

MAVS is a software library for simulating autonomous ground vehicles in off-road terrain. It simulates the sensors, vehicle, and environment. MAVS uses physics-based models to simulate camera, lidar, and radar interacting with environmental features such as rain, dust, and fog.



Software documentation for the MAVS library is here:

You can request access to MAVS here:
